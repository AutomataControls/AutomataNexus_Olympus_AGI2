n No, those are regular Linux/Unix drivers. For WSL2 GPU support, you need the special Windows driver that enables
  GPU passthrough to WSL.

  You need to install this on the Windows side (not in WSL):

  NVIDIA GPU Driver for WSL
  Download from: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl

  Or directly: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&t
  arget_type=exe_local

  This is a special Windows driver that:
  - Installs on Windows (not Linux)
  - Enables GPU passthrough to WSL2
  - Includes CUDA support for WSL2

  Steps:
  1. Download the Windows WSL GPU driver
  2. Install it on Windows (regular Windows installer)
  3. Restart Windows
  4. Open WSL and run nvidia-smi - it should work now
  5. Ollama will automatically use the GPU

  The key difference is this driver enables the GPU sharing between Windows and WSL2. Regular Linux drivers won't
  work because WSL2 doesn't have direct hardware access - it needs Windows to share the GPU.

  Want me to create a script to check if you already have GPU support or need to install it?

> yes bc i cant find the driver to download

● I'll create a PowerShell script to check your GPU and help you get the right driver:

● Write(../../check-gpu-wsl.ps1)
  ⎿  Wrote 92 lines to ../../check-gpu-wsl.ps1
     # Check GPU and WSL2 GPU Support Script
     Write-Host "=== GPU and WSL2 Support Checker ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
     # Check GPU info
     Write-Host "`nDetecting GPU..." -ForegroundColor Green
     $gpu = Get-WmiObject Win32_VideoController | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*NVIDIA*" }
     if ($gpu) {
         Write-Host "Found GPU: $($gpu.Name)" -ForegroundColor Green
         Write-Host "Driver Version: $($gpu.DriverVersion)" -ForegroundColor Gray
     … +82 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now run this script in PowerShell:

  D:\check-gpu-wsl.ps1

  This script will:
  1. ✓ Detect your exact GPU model
  2. ✓ Check if you already have WSL GPU support
  3. ✓ Give you the correct download link for your specific GPU
  4. ✓ Test if GPU is already working in WSL

  If the script shows you need the driver, here's the most common direct download that works for most RTX GPUs:

  Latest NVIDIA WSL2 GPU Driver (Oct 2024):
  https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.6.0/local_installers/cuda_12.6.0_560.28.03_windows.exe

  This is a ~3GB download that includes:
  - WSL2 GPU support
  - CUDA toolkit
  - Works with all RTX cards

  Run the PowerShell script first to see if you already have it!

> ok i have the toolkit .exe downloading now

● Great! While that's downloading (~3GB), here's what will happen:

  During Installation:
  1. Run the .exe as Administrator
  2. Choose "Express Installation" (it will handle WSL2 automatically)
  3. It will install both Windows driver + WSL2 GPU support
  4. Important: You'll need to restart Windows after

  After Restart, let's test it:

● Write(../../test-gpu-ollama.sh)
  ⎿  Wrote 56 lines to ../../test-gpu-ollama.sh
     #!/bin/bash
     # Test GPU support and setup Ollama for GPU
     echo "=== Testing GPU Support ==="
     echo
     # Test nvidia-smi
     echo "Checking for GPU access..."
     if nvidia-smi > /dev/null 2>&1; then
         echo "✓ GPU detected!"
     … +46 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Bash(chmod +x /mnt/d/test-gpu-ollama.sh)
  ⎿  (No content)

● After installing and restarting:

  1. Open WSL and run:
  /mnt/d/test-gpu-ollama.sh

  2. You should see your GPU info and Ollama will use it automatically
  3. The difference will be dramatic:
    - Before (CPU): 30-60 seconds for responses
    - After (GPU): 2-5 seconds for responses
  4. You can monitor GPU usage with:
  watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

  This will show GPU memory usage and utilization while Ollama runs.

  Let me know when you've installed and restarted!
